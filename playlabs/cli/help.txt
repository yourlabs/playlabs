Playlabs: the obscene ansible distribution.

Init your ssh user with your key and secure sshd and passwordless sudo:

    playlabs init root@1.2.3.4
    # all options are ansible options are proxied
    playlabs init @somehost --ask-become-pass

Now your user can install roles:

    playlabs install ssh,docker,firewall,nginx @somehost

And deploy a project, examples:

    playlabs @somehost deploy image=betagouv/mrs:master
    playlabs @somehost deploy
        image=betagouv/mrs:master
        plugins=postgres,django,uwsgi
        backup_password=foo
        prefix=ybs
        instance=hack
        env.SECRET_KEY=itsnotasecret
    playlabs @somehost deploy
        prefix=testenv
        instance=$CI_BRANCH
        image=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA

If you have that work, creating an inventory is the way to move on, wether you
want to version configuration, add a deploy user for your CI, configure a
secret backup password, add ssh-keys ...:

    playlabs scaffold ./your-inventory
