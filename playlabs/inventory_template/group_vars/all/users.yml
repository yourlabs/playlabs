# This YAML document defines a list of users for playlabs ansible playbooks.
# You can have an automated job that will update users for example with
# `playlabs install ssh` and then users will get their credentials deployed on
# git push.
#
# You need the ansible vault password in cleartext a file that will not be
# tracked in git to edit secret variables such as passwords. You should create
# this file with the ``.vault`` name at the root of your inventory repository
# clone then you can use ansible-vault commands with the ``--vault-id .vault``
# argument ie.::
#
#     echo -n your password | ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id .vault > passwords/hacker
#     ansible-vault view --vault-id .vault passwords/hacker
#     ansible-vault rekey --vault-id .vault passwords/hacker

users:
- name: hacker
  email: hacker1337@example.pcom
  roles:
    ssh: [sudo]
    k8s: [cluster-admin]
    # that one should only be used on an nginx-proxy host, not on a k8s host !
    netdata: [sysadmin, domainadmin, dba, webmaster, proxyadmin]
    # superuser on all project instances
    project: [superuser]
    # setting role on group works both ways: don't have groups and roles with
    # the same name
    superuser:
    - ci
    - project-staging
    - sentry

# The example inventory provides one deploy user, than has no sudo
# access, except for the backup scripts that it cannot write.
# He has an ssh account because playlabs found a key in keys/deploy.pub.
# For deploy user, we have a key without password, that is supposed to be
# crypted with ansible-vault before commit:
#
#     $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -f keys/deploy
#     $ echo -n your vault password > .vault
#     $ ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id .vault keys/deploy
- name: deploy
  sudo:
  - /home/*/backup.sh
  - /home/*/docker-run.sh
  - /usr/bin/docker pull *
  - /usr/bin/docker inspect *
  - /usr/bin/docker run * id -u
  - /usr/bin/docker logs *

# The productowner user does not have ssh access because it does not have a
# public key in keys/productowner.pub.
#
# However, productowner have a password to pass through htaccess security, for
# roles and projects that have it enabled.
#
# To generate your own crypted password run this command:
#
#     $ echo -n your vault password > .vault
#     $ echo -n password | ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id .vault > passwords/yourproductowner
- name: productowner
  superuser:
  - project-staging

# Playlabs will remove users in this list
users_remove:
- name: olduser

# Name of the user that will be able to write /home/service/docker-image
deploy_user: deploy  # not used on k8s host, only for nginx-proxy hosts
